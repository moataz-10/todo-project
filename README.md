A full todo Application with microservices architecture and CI/CD 

I used Github Actions to build the new commits and pushes it to docker registry

And I used Argo CD to watch my new deployments and apply it automatically to my cluster 

you can find it under --> production_Argo_CD , staging_Argo_CD

this application has two different environments Staging and Production
